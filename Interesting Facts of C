If you want to see how a file looks after :

The pre processing has been done:
use following command in linux
suppose your filename is file1.c

  gcc -E file1.c > file1.i
  
file1.i will be the output,you can open the file1.i in text editor.

Now you can give this file to a compiler 

  gcc -S file1.i
  
The output of above command will be a file that is in assembly language -- named -- file1.s

giving this file to assembler will generate object file, command for that will be

  gcc -c file1.s
  
output of above command will be file1.o an object file for your code.
